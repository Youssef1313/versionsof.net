.NET Core versioning is a mess. There are lots and lots and lots of verion numbers, from runtime to SDK, from Visual Studio to languages and of course .NET Standard. So what SDK corresponds to which runtime again? I know there some sort of a system, but I haven't quite figured it out yet. This website uses information published in the [.NET Core repo](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/releases-index.json) to give an overview of all the versions of .NET Core.
